## About The Project

This is a simple e-commerce website based on a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/MSyCAqVy1UgNap0pvqH6H3/Junior-Frontend-Test-Designs-(Public)?node-id=0-1&t=wheeFkltpCq2DbKL-0) and a graphhQL[API](https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint), built with React & Redux. The user can navigate through the different categories and products, add/remove items from the cart, and see the prices for different currencies.
